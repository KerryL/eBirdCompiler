# eBirdCompiler
Application for "compiling" a list of combined sightings from checklist URLs.

This application works by parsing eBird checklist web pages.  This is convenient for generating compiled lists with a short turn-around (i.e. without waiting for the 15th of the month in order to use the eBird Basic Dataset), but it makes the interface very fragile.

Some features, like summing the number of participants and individual counts are unreliable, also due to the weak interface.  Still, it can be a handy tool for quickly summarizing tallies from multiple eBird Checklists.
